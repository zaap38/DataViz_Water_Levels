## Description

Our visualization can be saw on https://zaap38.github.io/

The aim of this project is to warn public about global warming.
To do that, we created two visualizations showing predictions of rising water levels in the futur, which is one of the consequences of this phenomenon.
The first one is a bar chart showing the sea level according to the altitude of common cities.
The second is map of French departments showing the number of persons affected by rising water levels for each one.

## Scoping document

The [scoping document](DocumentCadrage.pdf) is at the root of the project.

## Data

You can find all our data in the **/db** folder.
We get some from here:
 - https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/
 - https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/correspondance-code-insee-code-postal/table/

Some others were created by us using Python scripts located in the same folder. These data were created from real data and predictions but re-arranged to perfectly fit within our visualizations.

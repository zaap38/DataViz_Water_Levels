## Description

The aim of this project is to raise public awareness of global warming.
To do that, we have created 2 visualization that show predictions of rising water levels, which is one of the consequences of this phenomenon.
THe first one is a bar chart that show the sea level in relation to the altitude of common cities.
The second is map a French departments that show the number of population affected by rising water levels for each one.

## Scoping document

The [scoping document](DocumentCadrage.pdf) is at the root of the project.

## Data

You can find all our data in the **/db** folder.
We get some from here:
 - https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/
 - https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/correspondance-code-insee-code-postal/table/

Some others were created by us with Python scripts that are in the same folder. These data were created from real data and predictions but re-arrange to perfectly fit with our visualizations.

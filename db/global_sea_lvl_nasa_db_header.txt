HDR Global Mean Sea Level Data
HDR
HDR This file contains Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) variations computed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center under the 
HDR auspices of the NASA Sea Level Change program. The GMSL was generated using the Integrated Multi-Mission Ocean Altimeter Data for 
HDR Climate Research (http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/MERGED_TP_J1_OSTM_OST_ALL_V5). It combines Sea Surface Heights from 
HDR TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, OSTM/Jason-2, and Jason-3 to a common terrestrial reference frame with all inter-mission biases, range and 
HDR geophysical corrections applied and placed onto a georeferenced orbit. This creates a consistent data record throughout 
HDR time, regardless of the instrument used.
HDR
HDR The data can be found below. A separate figure file, Global_Sea_Level_Graph, was generated using the GMSL data (listed in 
HDR column 12 below) with the 60-day Gaussian type filter and having the Global Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) applied, with annual 
HDR and semi-annual signals removed.
